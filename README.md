# UFO Space Survival
You are in the Galaxy trying to survive while the Aliens in UFOs try to invade you. So far I have the Endless Survival mode working properly. In that mode, 2 players must be connected using controllers only, and once both are connected the game will start. The game will go on where both players are in space trying to survive as many waves of the Aliens as possible. 

This game goes on as long as you and your teammate can survive. The game ends when both of you die. If one of you die and the other player is still alive, the game will continue with the dead player staying dead, and the alive player trying to survive alone. However, if the alive player survives the whole wave to continue to the next, then that dead player will be back alive again for the next wave. This keeps going on endlessly until both players are dead.

Controls are: Move-Left Stick, Aim-Right Stick, Shoot-Right Trigger

Players: 2 (Must have 2 controllers) (Cannot start the game with 1 player)
